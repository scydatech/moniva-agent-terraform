"""
Moniva procedures knowledge base ingestion.
Triggered by S3 changes under approved/ and by a schedule. Starts a Bedrock KB ingestion job.
If a job is already running:
  - S3-triggered runs raise an error so Lambda's async retry tries again a few minutes later;
  - scheduled runs simply skip (the next scheduled run will catch up).
Folder markers (keys ending in "/") are ignored.
